- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TR397
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ...
-Getting the Working Title CJ4 on MSFS 2020 to work.
I am 84, retired airlione pilot including 4000 hours 767/757 glass cockpit with Collins FMC.
I know how to use the real FMC
The CJ4 a year ago had a rather non-functioning FMC.
When WT ... 13 came out, heaven ,, FMC worked. 
Microsoft update 10 came out and all CJ4 cockipt screens turned white.
WT ... 14 fixed the white screens but reverted the CJ4 back to the old default.
Now I cannot get back the functiopning FMC on the CJ4.
Reinstalling MSFS twice did good. (Unable to delete stuff on x-box cloud.)
Help an old man!
